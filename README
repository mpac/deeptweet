DEEPTWEET DOCUMENTATION


I. OVERVIEW

DeepTweet is a two-phase Twitter search platform.  It allows you to cast a wide 
net using the Twitter Search API and then refine the results locally.  You can 
thus search for many combinations of words without worrying about API limits, 
and perform sophisticated analyses on the data.


II. INSTALLATION

For installation instructions, see the "install.txt" file included in this 
distribution.


III. ITEMS

Items contain terms, Item Spellings, that are Twitter search terms.  For 
example, an Item named "Open Source" could contain Spellings "open 
source", "open src", "opensource", and "opensrc".

Spellings are required and the Item name is NOT used as a search term.

Twitter hashtags are allowed but they are usually not required for good search 
results.


IV. TARGETS

Targets contain terms, Target Spellings, that are local search terms.  For
example, a Target named "Linux" could contain Spellings "linux", "lnux", 
"linx", and "lnx".

Spellings are required and the Target name is NOT used as a search term.

Feel free to experiment with Sphinx search symbols.


V. RADII AND MODIFIERS

Radii and Modifiers are used to provide location based searches.  They will be 
documented later.  For now, just use the defaults, or see how they work by 
reading the source code.


VI. SYSTEM EXECUTION

dt1.sh harvests tweets from Twitter and indexes the Tweet table.  dt2.sh runs 
the local search.  Each new batch of Tweets is then moved from the Tweet table 
to the Processed Tweet table to keep the indexer running quickly for future 
batches.


VII. ADMINISTRATION TIPS

To be documented later.


VIII. EXTENDING THE SYSTEM

To be documented later.
